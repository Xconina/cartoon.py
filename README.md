    I need to make a cartoon face using the graphics library statements

    Other features: hair, earrings, nose, hat, background, shirt, bow
    Use graphics library 
        Shapes
            Circle(Point (x,y), Radius)
            Rectangle(Point(top x, top y), Point(bottom x,bottom y))
            Oval(Point(top x,top y), Point(bottom x,bottom y))
            Polygon(Point(x,y) **repeat until done**)

    **Remember to put bottom layers near top of code. Everything at bottom will be on top of picture

Making the Cartoon  
    To plan my cartoon, I got graph paper and drew a grid. Then I made a simple cartoon with a circle, two eyes, and a mouth. I would plot the coordinates and use those 
    in the formulas above. 
    I ended up enjoying the process, so I kept drawing more and translating it to code.
